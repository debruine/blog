This tutorial will walk you through generating a dataset using a function modified from [Simulating Random Slopes][simulating-random-slopes] and comparing the output of a mixed effects model with the output of ANOVAs run on the data aggregated by subjects or by stimuli. We'll use the `afex` package to run our ANOVAs.
